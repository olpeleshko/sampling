# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of the survey is to determine the reasons behind high turnover rate across entry and lower-level positions at the company in the past 3 months. In addition, the survey will attempt to determine potential actions that can be taken to reduce the turnover.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population - employees at entry and lower-level positions currently employed by the company. Entry/lower-level positions can be based on the level number (if one exists at the company) or salary band
Sampling frame - employee directory (e.g. list of names, email addresses, and level/salary bands)
Sampling units - employees at entry and lower-level positions 
Observational units - employees at entry and lower-level positions 
Overall sampling strategy - we will use Simple Random Sampling (SRS) by sending a survey link by email to a sample employees at entry/lower-level positions, with assumption that every employee in our target population has access to email and checks it periodically. The survey will be kept anonymous to mitigate bias and increase response rates.

```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. Are you considering leaving the company in the next 6 months? (Very Likely / Likely / Unlikely / Very Unlikely / Unsure)
2. How satisfied with your salary? (Very Satisfied / Satisfied / Unsatisfied / Very Unsatisfied / Unsure)
3. How satisfied are you with your manager? (Very Satisfied / Satisfied / Unsatisfied / Very Unsatisfied / Unsure)
4. How satisfied are you with your coworkers? (Very Satisfied / Satisfied / Unsatisfied / Very Unsatisfied / Unsure)
5. How satisfied are you with career opportunities at the company? (Very Satisfied / Satisfied / Unsatisfied / Very Unsatisfied / Unsure)
6. How many days do you work from the office per week, on average? (4-5 days per week, 2-3 days per week, 1 day per week, Remote)
7. What is your commute time to the office? (0-30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, 1 to 2 hours, 2 hours or longer)
```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type was stratified sampling, with stratas based on geographic areas. There was a total of 27 strata, with most (but not all) Census Metropolitan Areas (CMAs) assigned their own strata. Survey designers also used rejective sampling to remove non-volunteers early in the survey process
2. Sample size - the sample size was 16,149 (target was 20,000).
3. Target population - all persons 15 years of age and older in Canada, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, as well as full-time residents of institutions
4. Sampling frame - the sampling frame was based on (1) list of telephone numbers in use (landline/cellular) from Statistics Canada, and (2) the Address Register (AR). The AR was used to group together telephone numbers linked to the same address. If there was no link between telephone number / AR, the telephone number was still included in the sampling frame to ensure coverage.
5. Survey mode(s) - self-completed electronic questionnaire or computer-assisted telephone interview
6. Timeline - the interviews were conducted from Sept 4th to Dec 28th, 2018
7. Response rate - the overall response rate was 41.9%
8. Weights 
- Initial weight to account for some households that had a higher chance of being selected (contacted through more than one group of phone numbers)
- Weights for responding households were adjusted to represent non-responding households (with latter being dropped)
- Person weight was calculated by multiplying household weight by the number of persons 15 years or older in that household
- Several other adjustments were made to account for Rejective Sampling, person weights to external totals, stratum adjustment, income adjustment, province - age - sex adjustment, and ranking ratio adjustments
9. Data processing
- Data was captured by either self-completing an eletronic questionnaire or telephone interviews
- Some questions allowed write-in responses, and required coding
- Some out-of-scope records were discovered and removed from the sample
- Records with missing/incorrect values were imputed
- A number of variables were derived from the questionnaire to help with data analysis
- Steps were taken to protect confidentiality
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
- Some out of scope (age or phone-number ownership-related) respondents were identified and removed from the sample
- Records with missing/wrong information were corrected deterministically (in some cases) or imputed from other information in the questionnaire or via donor imputation
11. Sources of error
- Some households in the survey frame had probability of being reached through more than one record
- Phone numbers linked to a wrong household
- Phone numbers not having an AR linked to a household that was already sampled
- Errors derived through imputation for missing values / non-response errors
- Respondents providing incorrect information (e.g. desirability bias)
- Errors in processing / data entry
- Sampling errors
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
- Residents of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut were excluded from the sample
- Full-time residents of institutions were excluded from the sample
- Households without telephone number were excluded from the sample
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used
